 * SX1272.
 *
 * Additional behaviors featured in this class include a State member variable
 * that expresses the current state of the device (SLEEP, TX, RX or STANDBY),
 * and a frequency and Spreading Factor this device is listening to when in
 * STANDBY mode. After transmission and reception, the device returns
 * automatically to STANDBY mode. The decision of when to go into SLEEP mode
 * is delegateed to an upper layer, which can modify the state of the device
 * through the public SwitchToSleep and SwitchToStandby methods. In SLEEP
 * mode, the device cannot lock on a packet and start reception.
